# TypeScript
- Keep strict type-safety; avoid `any`; type exported APIs and class fields.
- Guard assumptions with `assert`/`assertAndGet`; prefer early returns and shallow control flow.
- Interop: treat WASM memory as unsafe I/O; validate pointers/lengths; read via DataView with explicit endianness.
- Rendering: build DOM only from parsed data; attach events only when callbacks exist; avoid side effects in render.
- Reliability: fail fast with clear errors; donâ€™t swallow exceptions.
- Hygiene: preserve import paths/extensions; do not reformat unrelated code.
