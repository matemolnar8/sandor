# Schema sync
- Keep TS parsing logic aligned with C `Element` structs and union fields.
- If C element types or field layout changes, update TS offsets and element handling together.
- Preserve the attributes encoding contract (key/value pairs) unless TS is updated in lockstep.
- After C changes, rebuild WASM and verify interactions (click, input, canvas) in the example app.
