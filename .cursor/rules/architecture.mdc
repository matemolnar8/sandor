# Architecture & workflow
- Core library in C (`sandor.h`); browser bridge in TS (`example/src/wasm-component.ts`).
- Build: Vite app in `example/`; C→WASM via `./nob`.
- TS↔WASM contract: stable exports for render/events/memory layout; host provides logging/rerender/animation/canvas.
- Dev
  - `cd example && npm run dev`
  - `./nob` to rebuild WASM during edits
  - `npm run build` for production
- Adding an app: new `example/sandor-apps/*.c`, include in `nob.c`, list in `app-switcher.ts`.
